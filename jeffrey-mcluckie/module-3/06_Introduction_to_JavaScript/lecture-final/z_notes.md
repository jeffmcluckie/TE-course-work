# Intro to JavaScript

It is the ubiquitous language of Front-end web development. Might as well love it, cuz you won't get away from it (and honestly, it's pretty awesome).

## Fun JS Facts
- JS runs in web browsers natively
  - Can also install an interpreter (like Node.js) to run JS outside the browser
- Interpreted language, not compiled
- Dynamically typed - so you don't specify a type as you declare your variables (variables can change type)
  - Note Java statically typed language - variables only hold one type forever

- Variables
  - Variables Names
  - Declaring Variables
  - var, let & const
- Datatypes
- Operators and Arithmetic
- Type Conversion
