# Vue Events

We'll look at events for gathering data from a form (very similar to JS Events last Thurs).

## Objectives

- Implement event handling using Vue using the `v-on` directive
- Use "event modifiers", like propagation and default, in Vue
- Use the `methods:` property of the Vue object to define methods for a component
- Utilize component methods inside of event handlers
