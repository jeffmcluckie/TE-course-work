# Module 1 Assessment Exercise

The assessment helps you validate your understanding of the module one objectives:
* Variables and data types 
* Conditional and iteration logic 
* Object-Oriented Programming 
* File I/O and Collections
* Unit Testing 

It also gives you practice with coding assessments you may encounter during the job interview process.

## Overview

This is a time-boxed, individual coding assessment. You have one hour to complete the assessment. You are not expected to complete all the features of the problem in the time given. Complete as much as you can.

You may use any resource available as long as the effort remains an individual effort. 
__Don't chat with your peers or other "people" resources you may have available. __

Whatever you submit should not have compile or run-time errors. Features that are completed should run successfully to receive credit. Any unit tests you write should be error-free and run successfully.

If you are nearing the end of the assessment and you have compile/run-time errors, consider commenting out or removing the code that causes the errors.

At the end of the assessment, push your final project to your repository. We will look specifically for everyone to have pushed something up at the end of the hour.

If you finish before the end of the hour, please be respectful of those still working. (Don't ping others on Slack, Discord, etc as they may still be working. Even just asking someone can interrupt them and cause anxiety if they are not finished.)
